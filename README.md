Getting Started
To dive into the world of C++ game development, ensure you have a C++ compiler and, if applicable, the necessary game development libraries like SFML or SDL installed on your system. Explore the individual game folders for instructions on building and running each game.

Example Usage:
// Example usage for a console-based game
#include <iostream>
#include "path/to/game_file.h"

int main() {
    // Launch the game
    Game::start();

    return 0;
}
